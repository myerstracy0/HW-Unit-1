* GreenSky, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on July 12, 2017.

* David Zalik

* Still, Zalik had determination, along with tech smarts and Atlanta connections. In 2010, his original partner sold his stake and in stepped Robert Sheft, an investor who had founded RMA Home Services, which arranged the installation of windows and siding sold at Home Depot. When Zalik hit on the idea of helping small-business folk offer instant financing to consumers, the pair naturally started with home contractors. Zalik took local contractors to lunch and begged them to give GreenSky financing a try. His big pitch: less hassle than offering their customers financing from stalwarts like Wells Fargo and GE (now Synchrony).

* Financing from stalwarts like Wells Fargo and GE (now Synchrony). In the fall of 2014, Zalik and other insiders sold 17% of GreenSky at a $1.8 billion valuation to TPG, Wellington Management, Iconiq Capital, and DST Global. Two years later, Fifth Third invested at double that valuation.

## Business Activities:
